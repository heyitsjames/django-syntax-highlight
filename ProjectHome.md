The project aims to provide utilities for easy syntax highlighting in Django projects. Currently it provides few template tags for highlighting a number of different syntaxes.
The application requires the [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) library.
A demo Django project is bundled with the application.
To use it in your own projects the application needs to be somewhere in your PYTHONPATH and added to your INSTALLED\_APPS setting.
